# CNN Projects

## This repo contains several CNN projects:
* [Bunny or dog](Bunny_or_Dog.ipynb) - a model that classify bunnies / dogs.
* [Cat or dog](Cat_Or_Dog.ipynb) - a model that classify cats / dogs.
* [Martial art moves](Fighting_Actions_Predictor.ipynb) - a model that classify martial art moves (I used Jab and Hook on this model). You can read more about it in my [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/fighting-actions-predictor-aka-fap-f1c9ce4c6d03)
